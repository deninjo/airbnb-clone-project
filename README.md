## Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern technology stack to build a scalable, secure, and feature-rich Airbnb Clone platform. Each component plays a critical role in delivering the application's core functionality.

### 1. Django  
**Purpose:** Django is a high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It simplifies the development of secure and maintainable web APIs and includes built-in support for authentication, ORM, and admin interfaces.

### 2. PostgreSQL  
**Purpose:** PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system used to store structured data, such as user information, bookings, property listings, and reviews. It integrates seamlessly with Django via Django ORM.

### 3. GraphQL  
**Purpose:** GraphQL is used as an alternative to REST for querying and mutating data. It enables the frontend to request exactly the data it needs, improving performance and reducing bandwidth usage.

### 4. React  
**Purpose:** React is a JavaScript library used to build the user interface. It allows for the development of dynamic, responsive, and component-based frontend applications that interact with the backend via GraphQL or REST APIs.

### 5. Docker  
**Purpose:** Docker is used to containerize the application and its services (e.g., web server, database), ensuring consistency across development and production environments. It simplifies deployment and scaling.

### 6. Nginx  
**Purpose:** Nginx is used as a reverse proxy and static file server for the production environment. It handles incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to the appropriate backend service, improving performance and security.

### 7. Git & GitHub  
**Purpose:** Git is the version control system used to track changes in the codebase, and GitHub is the hosting platform for collaborating on development and managing code repositories.

### 8. CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions)  
**Purpose:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are implemented to automate testing, building, and deployment processes, ensuring high code quality and rapid delivery.
